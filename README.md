### Description
Borg is a current WIP that tries to parody a lot of the text adventures from the 90s. As I mentioned, it's a WIP, and a really, ***really*** early one. Right now it doesn't even have more than an enemy.

### Requirements for compiling
- **Windows XP and higher** *(sorry Linux users)*.
- **Python 3.X with PIP3**.
- **The following PIP packages:**
	- `termcolor` and `colorama` for vivid and wAcKy colors in your terminal :).
	- `winsound` for wins and sounds (currently unused, but I will include it in the next version).

### Compiling from source code
To compile, having the above requirements, just download the source code from this repo, unpack it in somewhere, go to that somewhere with your terminal and do `python main.py`. **Ta-da!**

### Todo
- **More enemies.**
- **Full plot** (.txt?).
- **More doggies.**
